### Setting up Google Cloud Text-to-Speech

1. Create a Google Cloud Project:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one
   - Enable the Cloud Text-to-Speech API

2. Create a Service Account:
   - Navigate to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Grant "Cloud Text-to-Speech API User" role
   - Create and download the JSON key file

3. Configure Environment Variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
GCP_TYPE="service_account"
GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
GCP_PRIVATE_KEY_ID="your-private-key-id"
GCP_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
GCP_CLIENT_EMAIL="your-client-email"
GCP_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
GCP_AUTH_URI="https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
GCP_TOKEN_URI="https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
GCP_AUTH_PROVIDER_CERT_URL="https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
GCP_CLIENT_CERT_URL="your-client-cert-url"
```

### Setting up Together AI

1. Sign up at [Together AI](https://www.together.ai)
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add to your `.env` file:
```env
TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:7860`

3. Use the interface to:
   - Search using text descriptions
   - Upload images for visual search
   - Record voice descriptions
   - Generate speech from case summaries
