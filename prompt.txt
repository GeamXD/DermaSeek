        summary text:
                Liana Barrientos, 39, is facing two criminal counts for falsifying a marriage license application in 2010, stating it was her "first and only" marriage, when in reality she had been married nine times between 1999 and 2002, with some occurring as often as two weeks apart. Prosecutors claim the marriages were part of an immigration scam, with some of her husbands filing for permanent residence status shortly after the marriages, and divorces only occurring after the filings were approved. Barrientos has been married to four men, and at one point was married to eight men simultaneously. She faces up to four years in prison if convicted.
